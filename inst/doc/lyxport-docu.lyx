\begin_layout Author
Mark Bravington,
 February 2025
\begin_inset Newline newline

updated for v1.0.182+
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
lyxport
\family default
 R package is for exporting LyX to MSWord--- which I sometimes have to do,
 under duress--- and perhaps other formats.
 Unlike LyX's built-in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

MS Word Open Office XML
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 export,
 Lyxport
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I don't approve of starting proper nouns with lower case.
 Causes more trouble than it's worth.
 Sure,
 software names might be spelt lower-case for reasonable reasons,
 but when referring to them,
 caps read more naturally in most cases.
 There's only one Pandoc.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 does proper cross-referencing including tables,
 figures,
 lists,
 equations,
 appendices,
 and bibliography;
 and it sorts out a few other quirks too.
 Most of the heavy lifting is still done by Pandoc,
 as in LyX's built-in export option.
 However,
 Pandoc--- wonderful though it is!--- doesn't get everything right even with well-known filters (as you have probably discovered yourself by now,
 else you mightn't be reading this).
 So Lyxport contains a lot of 
\emph on
my
\emph default
 behind-the-scenes fiddly code in order to save 
\emph on
you 
\emph default
lots of manual post-fiddling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use-case I have in mind is basically my own:
 you have prepared a long and lovely paper in LyX that generates a perfect and pretty PDF.
 But for some reason you have to submit it to some journal that insists on miserable misbegotten manuscripts in MSWord.
 Sigh--- I sincerely feel your pain!
 There might be several rounds of back-and-forth between you and the journal,
 so you reeeally don't want to have to repeatedly do manual edits of the Word version of an 80% successful conversion using an editor you hate.
 The conversion should look reasonably decent,
 citations and cross-refs should all be correct,
 etc;
 but journals always fart around with the appearance of tables etc,
 so there's no need to get 
\emph on
every
\emph default
 detail of appearance exactly matching between PDF and MSWord.
 And that's the level that Lyxport aims at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see the features,
 do File->Open_example and open 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

examples/lyxport-demo.lyx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I haven't tested every LyX feature;
 it's mostly just stuff I need.
 More things might get added.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you've installed and loaded the 
\family typewriter
lyxport
\family default
 package,
 read the helpery
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
My word for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

documentation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

—
 as distinct from the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

document
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 which means I can use the abbreviation 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

docu
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

doco
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 exclusively for the latter.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in 
\family typewriter
?lyxprefhack
\family default
,
 make sure its requirements are met,
 and then try running 
\family typewriter
lyxprefhack()
\family default
 to set things up for direct use from LyX.
 The helpery also explains how you can do the setup manually if 
\family typewriter
lyxprefhack
\family default
 doesn't work—
 it hasn't been tested on all OSes,
 and people's computer setups are notoriously variable...
 The helpery also explains how to test whether it has all worked.
 If you are reading this document from inside LyX,
 then that's a good sign,
 but not a cast-iron guarantee—
 the real test is whether you can do 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

File->Export_as->MSWord_(lyxport)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
 A good test document is the example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lyxport-demo.lyx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 which (if 
\family typewriter
lyxprefhack
\family default
 or your manual setup has worked) you should be open in LyX via 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

File->Open_example
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and searching.
 Try exporting it with LyX's built-in MSWord XML option,
 and then with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

MSWord (lyxport)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

;
 the differences will be obvious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also see a PDF version of this document in R,
 via 
\family typewriter
RShowDoc("lyxport-docu",package="lyxport")
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After setup,
 you won't normally use this package from R yourself;
 it will just be invoked from LyX.
 (The exception is if you want to use 
\family typewriter
requote_lyx
\family default
 or (in future) any other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

offline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 support function.
 However,
 a keen user could experiment with the core function 
\family typewriter
lyxzip2word 
\family default
(qv) directly,
 e.g.
 to produce other formats besides MSWord.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Do I need to modify my LyX document?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of additions to your document:
 possibly not,
 unless you are using citations\SpecialChar breakableslash
bibliography.
 If you are,
 then you will need to add one line of ERT to define the bibliography style.
 Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Bibliographies"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

) explains how,
 and mentions a few extra tweaks that you 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 want to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also,
 you 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 want to add some ERT to improve the appearance of the exported file (section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Pandoc-options"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from adding instructions to your document:
 there are general limitations on usable LyX features,
 some of which are stated below.
 So,
 you might need to change your document to not use features that don't work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Are there are any other useful functions in 
\family typewriter
lyxport
\family default
?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The helper function 
\family typewriter
requote_lyx 
\family default
tries to resolve inconsistent use of straight quotes,
 etc;
 you do have to use that manually from R,
 probably only once per LyX file.
 For example,
 I used it when creating this document,
 which was based on importing plain text files of R helpery.
 There's also those bibliography tweaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Versions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Version 1.0 of Lyport is written for Pandoc 3.5 and Pandoc-crossref v0.3.18.0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's quite possible that some of the problems which Lyxport 1.0 deals with,
 will actually be fixed in future releases of Pandoc.
 In that case,
 the Lyxport fixes might cause other problems..!
 Of course,
 I will try to maintain Lyxport accordingly,
 but I don't need Pandoc very often,
 so I might not get round to it quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note to myself really:
 what I should perhaps do for future-proofing,
 is make all the fix options switchable,
 and add a single character-string argument to 
\family typewriter
lyxzip2word
\family default
 which controls all options (it would be disentangled inside 
\family typewriter
lyxzip2word
\family default
).
 Then users could easily-enough hand-modify the LyX Converter,
 to add an appropriate version of the argument in the call to 
\family typewriter
lyxzip2word
\family default
.
 But I haven't done this yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bibliographies
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Bibliographies"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Citations seem to work fine,
 ie whatever you specify in LyX for the PDF version also appears in the Word version—
 including the different options for parentheses,
 commas,
 etc (which took me a 
\emph on
lot
\emph default
 of hacking!).
 However,
 for the bibliography itself,
 Pandoc does not understand "styles" in the same way that Biber\SpecialChar breakableslash
Biblatex does (or whatever animal of the Latex zoo it should be;
 I don't understand this stuff,
 and am happy to keep it that way).
 AFAICS none of the ways you can alter bibliography appearance in LyX/Latex will be understood.
 Instead,
 you'll need to specify a "CSL style" manually in your LyX source,
 as follows.
 First,
 you will need to get a suitable CSL file from the internet,
 eg via 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

https://editor.citationstyles.org/searchByExample
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and store it somewhere (see below for thoughts about where).
 Second,
 you'll need some ERT to tell Lyxport (which will then tell Pandoc) about the CSL.
 Here's two options:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%% CSL journal-of-applied-genetics.csl
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Next is a non-ERT fake,
 to appear only in PDF/MSWord output
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%% CSL journal-of-applied-genetics.csl
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%% CSL ./journal-of-applied-genetics.csl
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Next is a non-ERT fake,
 to appear only in PDF/MSWord output
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%% CSL ./journal-of-applied-genetics.csl
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first—
 i.e.,
 with no path—
 is generally better;
 the CSL file is available 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

globally
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for use by Lyxport on any LyX document.
 For that,
 you need to store the CSL file at the top of your biblio tree,
 ie in the folder "<top>" where "<top>/bibtex/bib/" contains the actual dot-bib file(s) you are using as biblio sources.
 (You would have told your Latex system about your biblio tree at some point.
 You might get lucky by trying 
\family typewriter
kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME
\family default
 in a shell.
 Or Google.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second option,
 with a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

./
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 assumes you store the CSL file 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

locally
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 ie in the same folder as the LyX document that's mentioning it.
 In that case,
 you'll also need to insert the file as a Verbatim child document inside a Comment,
 like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Comment
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand verbatiminput
filename "journal-of-applied-genetics.csl"
literal "false"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Next is a non-ERT fake,
 to appear only in PDF/MSWord output
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename fake-verbatim.png
	lyxscale 75

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Comment prevents the contents of the CSL file from appearing in the rendered document (eg in PDF form),
 but the mention of a child-document tricks LyX into including the CSL file during File->Export->Lyx-zip (which is done automatically for you,
 as the first step in conversion to MSWord etc).
 (If I'd realized how Comments actually work,
 I would have used that instead of ERT for CSL-specification in the first place.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you specify several CSLs with that 
\family typewriter
%% CSL
\family default
 mechanism,
 then only the final one will be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Capitalization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Biblatex/Biber seem to take account of capital letters without having to wrap them in {},
 but MSWord and CSS don't,
 so that references which work fine with the former sometimes don't with the latter,
 unless tweaks are made.
 
\family typewriter
lyxzip2word()
\family default
 therefore contains code to forcibly capitalize references (i.e.,
 changing the entries in a copy of the bibliography) where it looks like the user meant it.
 (Citations where the first word starts lower-case,
 e.g.
 for referring to a piece of Software,
 are also kept that way.) This might not be exactly the behaviour that 
\emph on
you
\emph default
 want,
 but 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 sure need it!
 So,
 you have to be careful to get your original biblio entries right;
 Capital in the database will mean Capital in the MSWord output,
 too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Same author,
 multiple names
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a dot-bib file,
 the same author can appear with slightly different names in different papers:
 "A.
 Psmith",
 "Alan Psmith",
 "Alan B.
 Psmith",
 "A.
 Bertram Psmith",
 and so on.
 If you are not careful,
 your citations can come out funny as a result.
 For example,
 you might see "Psmith et al.
 (1999)" but "A.B.
 Psmith (2004)" even though Alan Bertram is the only Psmith you are citing.
 With Biblatex and PDFs,
 you can suppress such nonsense via 
\family typewriter
uniquename=false
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
uniquelist=false
\family default
.
 But with CSL and MSWord etc,
 that (and pretty much everything :/) seems to be harder.
 
\family typewriter
lyxzip2word()
\family default
 sorts this out,
 rather forcibly,
 by calling 
\family typewriter
tidy_initials()
\family default
 for you.
 The default behaviour is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lumping
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 so that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A.B.
 Psmith
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A.
 Psmith
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will be assumed to both be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A.B.
 Psmith
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (but clear contradictions still won't be).
 You can turn that off by including one of these lines:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%% tidy_initials timid  # A.B.Psmith != A.Psmith
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%% tidy_initials false  # leave my bib file alone!!!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%% tidy_initials gungho # the default
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

%% tidy_initials false  # leave my bib file alone!!!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%% tidy_initials gungho # the default
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the hood:
 
\family typewriter
lyxzip2word()
\family default
 exports a mini-version of your dot-bib,
 containing only cited references.
 Then it runs 
\family typewriter
tidy_initials()
\family default
 on that,
 in turn running 
\family typewriter
tex2utf8()
\family default
 so that non-Latin characters hopefully get the same treatment as Latin ones.
 If you prefer to mod your bib at source beforehand,
 you can run either or both of those functions yourself.
 At your peril.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
DIY bib-hacking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CSL website I link to above is useful,
 but sometimes you just can't find a CSL that really does what you want;
 and editing an existing style seems incredibly difficult
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I did try.
 And I tried again.
 And I gave up.
 There are limits even to 
\emph on
my
\emph default
 obstinacy.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 One 
\emph on
desperate
\emph default
 option might be to temporarily hack Lyxport's temporary copy of your own biblio file so that it Looks Nicer (in case you don't want to change your original bib file),
 just as 
\family typewriter
tidy_initials()
\family default
 already does.
 For example,
 I wanted one particular institution to always be abbreviated,
 even though the bib file has it spelt out in full.
 So you can add your own R function to do that,
 along the lines below (it must be embedded in a Comment,
 as either ERT or perhaps a Program-Listing).
 The sole argument of the function should be a character vector (the text from the file),
 which your function should modify and return.

\begin_layout Section
Other formats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My requirement is for MSWord,
 so that's what I've concentrated on.
 Things might or might not work in other formats;
 almost all the work in Lyxport is in generating a nice native-Pandoc document,
 and the final export step is just up to Pandoc,
 so there is a good chance other output formats will work at least reasonably.
 You can experiment inside R with the 
\family typewriter
outext
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
panoutopts
\family default
 arguments of 
\family typewriter
lyxzip2word
\family default
.
 First,
 you will need to export your test document from LyX as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LyX archive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (lyxzip).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FWIW I personally would prefer to use ODT rather than MSWord if I could (since ODT is open-source and the MSWord 
\emph on
program
\emph default
 can import ODT),
 but unfortunately LibreOffice's maths importing is broken (as of v7.6 and for some time before that).
 [One example:
 the vertical bar,
 which I use extensively for conditional probability.
 But there's other things too.] "Barring" that for-me-deal-breaking limitation,
 'lyxzip2word' can export quite nicely to ODT,
 except figure sizes are not respected--- whether that's down to Pandoc's ODT writer,
 or to a limitation of ODT itself,
 I don't know.
 You'd need to manually resize all the figures within LO :/ Maybe there's an option in native Pandoc to specify figure sizes,
 in which case I could probably add code to do that--- but there's no point unless the ODT maths things get fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How it works
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In LyX,
 there needs to be a new "File Format" (in Preferences) which is an alias for the existing MSWord format.
 (The same would apply to any other desired type of output.) Then there needs to be a "Converter" from "Lyx-zip (archive)" format to the new alias.
 (These should be created automatically by 
\family typewriter
lyxprefhack
\family default
,
 or manually by you if necessary,
 as 
\family typewriter
?lyxprefhack
\family default
 explains.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you pick "File->Export->[new format alias]",
 LyX will realize that the only way to produce the new format is to first export to Lyx-zip (producing,
 yes,
 a dot-zip or dot-tar-dot-gz file),
 then to run the new Converter.
 The latter launches R,
 and runs 
\family typewriter
lyxport::lyxzip2word
\family default
 which does everything else,
 starting from that zip file.
 "Everything else" means:
 LyX -> Latex -> pre-process -> Pandoc-tex-to-native -> post-process -> Pandoc-native-to-MSWord-or-other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This package is very effective despite 
\emph on
my
\emph default
 limitations:
 I don't understand Pandoc's internal document structure,
 I have zero wish to learn new programming languages or arcane file formats,
 and I have a pretty limited understanding of Latex--- much of the point of LyX being to avoid having to remember all the Latex gruesome details!
 However,
 the good news is that LyX exports a highly structured and limited form of Latex (unless you insert really nasty ERT...) which makes it easy to partially-parse the file using 
\family typewriter
grep
\family default
 etc to find constructs that need attention.
 Similarly,
 Pandoc exports a highly-structured "native" format which IMO is much easier to partially-parse than JSON--- for example,
 indentation is highly consistent,
 so I can usually find the range of lines to 
\family typewriter
gsub
\family default
 etc by matching indentation size.
 Then I monkeyed around (a lot) until things worked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because I rely on LyX's specific and tidy structuring of its Latex exports,
 
\family typewriter
lyxzip2word

\begin_layout Standard
Pandoc uses an output-format-specific "template" or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reference-doc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to control some aspects of its output,
 eg fonts.
 See 
\family typewriter
https://pandoc.org/chunkedhtml-demo/6-templates.html
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--reference-doc
\family default
.
 You might want to change the template;
 for example,
 Pandoc's default choices for MSWord "bold" looks pretty weird to me.
 The template/reference-doc also seems to be the place where you set features such as line- and page-numbering.
 I have included an example,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

iwc-pandoc-reference.docx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
You should be able to find it from R with 
\family typewriter
system.file( 'examples/iwc-pandoc-reference.docx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

');

\family default
 or,
 from LyX,
 inside the 
\family typewriter
<userdir>/examples/lyxport
\family default
 folder.
 Copy it somewhere else before actually using it.
\end_layout

\end_inset

,
 which started from the default that Pandoc describes in the above links;
 note that,
 to have any effect,
 you must edit the 
\emph on
style
\emph default
 of an item,
 not the appearance of the item itself.
 Then you must also tell Pandoc which template to use,
 by adding ERT like this (which again will not be visible in the PDF or DOCX version):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%% Pandoc reference-doc ./iwc-pandoc-reference.docx
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some output formats,
 including MSWord,
 require a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reference-doc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 while others want a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

template
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

;
 so,
 use the appropriate word.
 As you see,
 you can specify different ones for different formats,
 which will be automatically selected depending on which Converter you invoke (if you have manually set up LyX Converters that use 
\family typewriter
lyxport
\family default
 for more formats than MSWord).
 File location works the same way as CSS bibliography styles.
 No path means top of the TEXMF tree,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

./
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means same folder as the document,
 in which case you need to add something like this (again,
 invisible in PDF and DOCX):

There are probably lots more than this.
 The list is in two parts,
 of which the first seems fairly permanent—
 it's structural stuff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Encoding must be set to UTF8 (Document->Settings->Language->Encoding).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Labels must start with the right prefix for the thing they are labelling:
 "tab:" for table-floats,
 "fig:" for figure-floats,
 "eq:" for equations,
 "sec/subsec/par:" for sectioning,
 and "enu:" for lists.
 LyX will do this automatically for you when you set up a label,
 unless you perversely force it not to;
 so,
 don't do that.

 Labels should therefore be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

sec:<blah>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 too.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In order to be noticed,
 tables & figures have to be in floats with labelled captions.
 Each float can contain several actual tables or figures,
 but only one label.
 Requiring a label is reasonable;
 how else would you alert the reader to the existence and role of the table inside the main text?!
 Numbered sections and numbered equations don't need labels,
 unless they are cross-referenced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Figures:
 No absolute paths.
 (Otherwise,
 Lyx-zip-export uses lots of subfolders and I can't find the files.) I'm not sure about relative paths that go "upwards" either (eg "../sister/image.png").
\end_layout

\begin_deeper

Greyed-out text doesn't work (Pandoc doesn't support colored text).
 It's a shame,
 coz that leaves no way to preserve comments-as-comments in the dot-docx version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 the biggest limitation is Pandoc's Latex reader,
 but there are other problems too.
 For example:
 the "cases" environment gets spurious RH paren on export,
 LibreOffice/ODT maths has got problems,
 ...
 Anyway,
 for the second part of the list,
 here are some current limitations that I 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 fix in future:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No Boxes (yet).
 In particular,
 resizebox and presumably its friends don't work (unfortunately,
 since I often use them to get tables to fit).
 Perhaps I should add code to delete them from the intermediate Latex files,
 so that at least something comes out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Table column widths are ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Only one Bibliography is produced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Equation numbering is either unsectioned (1,
 2,
 3 etc) or uses "section" as the prefix (1.1 etc).
 In principle it should also accept "chapter" or "part" for the prefix.
 Perhaps it should also allow user-specified arbitrary prefixes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Equations,
 Figures,
 and Tables in Appendices are numbered (A1,A2,...,B1,B2)--- no choice (and it's my preferred way).
 ¿Should I allow user-specced Apx encoding,
 eg S1,
 S2 instead of A,
 B?
 I don't know how to enforce any of this in LyX/Latex anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lists always use LyX's default numbering hierarchy,
 eg 1-a-i-A.
 And there's no support for Enumerate-Resume yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Citations are all author\SpecialChar breakableslash
year,
 rather than square-brackety.
 (Other than that,
 you can control citation appearance in the usual Latex ways.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This all needs Pandoc,
 ImageMagick (which at least on Windows should be installed automatically inside LyX's folder structure),
 and,
 of course,
 LyX itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The folders for the executables of Pandoc,
 LyX,
 and Rscript should be in the system path.
 If they aren't normally,
 then you can tell LyX to set them up automatically just within each LyX session,
 via "Tools->Preferences->Paths->PATH prefix".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am going to assume that R_LIBS_USER and so on correctly set the libraries,
 ie the path(s) to R package folders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The LyX userdir
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:The-LyX-userdir"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's a bug in LyX 2.4.3 (and some earlier versions) which means that,
 if you have a personal LyX userdir (which surely everyone does),
 it can't safely be made visible to LyX during the export operation.
 Normally this doesn't matter,
 because the userdir is mostly about interactive session stuff such as keybindings,
 but it does mean that any special modules in your "<userdir>/layouts" folder will not be visible.
 If you can't live without them,
 you will just have to copy them to your "<LyX-system-dir>/layouts" folder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LyX developers know about the bug,
 and apparently the very simple fix will appear in 2.4.4.
 Until then,
 for those who 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 want to know (be warned:
 do you 
\emph on
really
\emph default
?),
 the problem is this:
 
\family typewriter
lyxzip2word
\family default
 needs to call a standalone LyX instance in order to export a Latex version of the source.
 (Most of the needed files--- the LyX source itself,
 any include-files,
 graphics--- are first exported into the Lyx-zip archive which is produced automatically,
 but the Latex version needs to be exported separately.) There is a handy CLI option "lyx --export latex <blah>" for that.
 Unfortunately,
 the latter can fall over if the userdir is set,
 either on the invocation line via "-userdir <blahblah>",
 or via the "LYX_USERDIR_24x" envar.
 (The problem is if there's a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

uistyle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option within the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

preferences
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file—
 that's the bug that is being fixed.) Then LyX will crash with a SIGSEGV (and exit code 11 in Windows).
 When LyX calls Rscript,
 it 
\emph on
sets
\emph default
 that envar first--- which is normally good,
 coz it means that a converter could look at any userdir settings.
 However,
 when Rscript then calls LyX again,
 it will crash.
 So Rscript (ie 
\family typewriter
lyxzip2word
\family default
) has to 
\emph on
unset
\emph default
 that envar before calling LyX,
 which means that the second instance of LyX cannot know about your modules.
 You were warned!

 There was a bug,
 and then when I'd fixed it and tried again,
 it just seemed to be trying (and faililng) to convert the original file.
 What to do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A:
 This can occasionally happen with LyX's file cache not being cleared properly.
 It's a real pain.
 What you can try is going to the LyX tempdir,
 searching for your main dot-lyx and corresponding dot-zip file in all subfolders (they will probably be in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...tmpbuf<n>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

<n>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is an unpredictable number),
 and deleting them.
 It mainly seems to happen to me when I'm debugging Lyxport and exporting dot-zips manually from LyX,
 so hopefully you won't encounter it...

 Why did you use R rather than writing a series of

Pandoc
\emph on
 filters in SDGL to translate FSDOIG format,
 like you're supposed to?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A:
 Because I know R,
 and I have no interest in learning SDGL nor figuring out the intricacies of FSDOIG format.
 Also,
 modern R is really good for regexy manipulations--- people often don't realize that.
 If you don't already have R (which I expect many LyX users will),
 then it's not hard to install.

You clearly had to fix lots of issues.
 Why didn't you report them as bugs and wait for someone else to sort them out,
 like a logical systematic person would?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A:
 Because I needed this for my own purposes,
 and fairly quickly.
 Other people are busy,

 do it yourself

 That said,
 I really ought to get round to reporting the bugs at some point--- but reporting bugs is quite time-consuming.

\family typewriter

\family typewriter
eqnos

 If you try exporting

 However,
 I reluctantly concede that Lyxport does quite a good job of exporting to MSWord,

 Can I make use of it on my own superior Latex files?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A:
 How very gracious of you.
 But to answer your question:
 no,
 not directly on general Latex files.
 There might be other tools Out There for that.
 Lyxport relies on the tightly-structured flavour of Latex exported by LyX.
 Your only chance would be to import your Latex into LyX,
 then export.
