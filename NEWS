1.0.179: Added the "iwc-pandoc-reference.docx" file, to show how to improve appearance. Tweaked "lyxport-docu.lyx".

1.0.178: incorporated most of David Miller's mods re Macs/Linux; removed all attempts to modify path-prefix; streamlined the helpery for lyxprefhack() especially; added a self-test to lyxprefhack().

1.0.174: lyxprefhack() now tries to add R to path-prefix. Minor doco fixes.

1.0.169: Bugfixes with cross-refs.

1.0.162: 'lyxprefhack' now tries to deduce "userdir" from the appropriate envar (unless it has been passed as a parameter), before asking the user.

Fixed sectioning (and other) bug(s) when trying to export child document on its own. Probably.

1.0.157: Fixed some boring CRAN-check warnings. However, I have deliberately *not* fixed the one about non-portable characters in R files--- that's the whole bloody *point* of raw strings here. Grrr.
